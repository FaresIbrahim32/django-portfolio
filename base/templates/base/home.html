					<h4>My Experience as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>Starting as a Junior Developer Intern at DecOps LLC, I dove headfirst into React-based applications and API integration. What began as collaborative work with UX/UI designers quickly evolved into developing custom components and creating interactive animations that enhanced user engagement.</p>

<p>This experience led me to join the SHILED Lab at USF as a Student Research Assistant, where I've been developing Python scripts for data extraction and designing cognitive test interfaces using Flutter. Working with multidisciplinary teams to assess cognitive abilities in patients with brain trauma has shown me the real-world impact of technology in healthcare.</p>

<p>From building a 3D shirt customization platform to developing full-stack applications with Django and React, I consistently take on challenges that push my technical boundaries. This drive to tackle complex problems head-on is what defines my approach to software development.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>After almost two years of web devlopment, I’m ready to learn something new. I'll be indluging more into machine learning and its libraries so I can hopefully build my first ever CNN by the end of March.</p>
				<p>Aside from working on projects I would love to enter a position (internship or Co-op) where I can be part of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself.</p>
